# Welcome to Publish

<hr>

Publish is a new academic writing platform designed to bring research articles into the 21st century by building them specifically for the web. The platform works in a similar format to LaTeX but rather than compile to a pdf, Publish creates a HTML page.

This means that your research paper is now designed for the web and can be read on any device anywhere in the world. The paper will automatically fit to the screens size so you won't have any more issues in have to zoom and pan around a pdf on your mobile device.

It also enables richer content to be embedded within the paper including:

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-video-camera"></i> HD &amp; 4K Video</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-picture-o"></i> High-Resolution Imagery</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-volume-up"></i> High-Quality &amp; Lossless Audio</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-code"></i> Syntax Highlighted Code</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-database"></i> Open Access Datasets</li>
</ul>

This further enhances the reporting and re-usability of your research and also enhances the search-ability of your papers so that other researchers will be able to find your research quicker and easier <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>.

We are working closely with ... and are pushing for Publish to be the new method of publishing research articles.

We have an extensive [roadmap](https://github.com/JamesGopsill/Publish/projects/1) and are quickly developing the platform with new features being added weekly. We also have a dedicated website for you upload your papers to so that they are available for all the world to see.

We're a growing community and really want you to be part of it. Please download the tool and give it a go. We're would really like to hear your feedback as well as see your papers online!
