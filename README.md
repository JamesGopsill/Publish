# Publish
[Dr. James Gopsill](http://jamesgopsill.github.io)

Publish is a new academic writing platform designed to bring research articles into the 21st century by building them specifically for the web. The platform works in a similar format to LaTeX but rather than compile to a pdf, Publish creates a HTML page.

This means that your research paper is now designed for the web and can be read on any device anywhere in the world. The paper will automatically fit to the screens size so you won't have any more issues in have to zoom and pan around a pdf on your mobile device.

It also enables richer content to be embedded within the paper including video, audio, code and datasets, which further enhances the reporting and re-usability of your research! It also enhances the search-ability of your papers so that other researchers will be able to find your research quicker and easier.

We are working closely with ... and are pushing for Publish to be the new method of publishing research articles.

We have an extensive roadmap and are quickly developing the platform with new features being added weekly. We also have a dedicated website for you upload your papers to so that they are available for all the world to see.

We're a growing community and really want you to be part of it. Please download the tool and give it a go. We're would really like to hear your feedback as well as see your papers online!

# Installation

The first thing you need to do to get up and running is to have node installed on your system. Node.js installers can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). To confirm that you have node installed and running on your system, you can open a terminal/command prompt window and run the following command:

```

$ node -v

```

This should display the version of node that you're running on your system.

Now that you have node installed, you can use the built-in node package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) to install the Publish onto your system. Again, in the terminal/command prompt run the following command.

```

$ npm install -g publish

```

This will install the Publish in your global node environment and enable you to call it anywhere on your system.
